WE ARE FIRST CONVERTING ETF txt. FILES INTO csv. FILES FOR EASIER HANDLING, WRANGLING, MANIPULATION ETC.
might not be converting files, first we are going to sort the different ETF's by who they are managed by
For example, all ETF's managed by RBC, will be in "etfs.rbc.txt" or something similar
/nov. 25th @2:00pm

So this turned into its own part of the project:
We will be breaking down ETF's by company and comparing their performance
Within my dataset there were hundreds of ETF's that are no longer active today 
(from my first rudimentary analysis, it seems alot of smaller funds may have closed due to the market crash in february/march, I may include this in a separate tableau dashboard)
Once all the .txt files are sorted into their proper folder, the cleaned data set will be uploaded here.
/nov. 25th @8:20pm

added cleaned etf data, separated by managing company
