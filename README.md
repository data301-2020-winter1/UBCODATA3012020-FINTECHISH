## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

By the end of the project I would like to create an easy to use dashboard that analyzes stocks or ETF's, comparing different statistics like standard deviation, market exposure (beta), and P/E ratio. 
I would love to do this using a combination of Excel, R studio and Python, all three languages/applications already have plenty of publicly available tools and packages to breakdown and analyze the data further. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Currently the master raw dataset has thousands of stocks and ETF's. With 5 variables which are Open, close, high, low, and volume. I can currently only obtain these five variables, I plan of finding a way to include financial information like earnings, dividends, splits, and possibly plot major news/economic events. 
This data set was obtained from kaggle, listed under Stocks and ETF's, it collects data from every day since inception, going all the way to 2017. It was difficult finding free stock data that was useful and did not require an API, but these challenges will be overcome by the end of the project.

## Team Members

I am currently majoring in International Relations and am very interested in taking a data science minor. I have had a strong interest in stocks and finance since I was in junior high, so this project is a perfect opportunity to use that knowledge in a data science format.
